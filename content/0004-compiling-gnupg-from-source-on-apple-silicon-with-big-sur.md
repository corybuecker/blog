Compiling a program like GnuPG (GPG) from source is not difficult. But, there are many individual dependencies and this post breaks them down.

## What about Homebrew?

These instructions are not meant to be a substitute for [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). Homebrew is an excellent package manager run by dedicated contributors. At the time I wrote this, Homebrew support for GnuPG on Apple Silicon was still being completed and certified.

## Build environment

On a Mac, I don't install programs and libraries into the `usr` folder. Rather, I have a folder called `tools` in my home directory. I have my `PATH` configured as:

```bash
export PATH="/Users/corybuecker/tools/bin:$PATH"
```

I have installed _Xcode 12.2_ rather than the developer tools. The developer tools should would work just fine.

Setting the `tools` directory as an environment variable will make the following steps easier.

```bash
export PREFIX="/Users/corybuecker/tools"
```

Also, many of these packages have been updated to work on Apple Silicon, but they don't always detect the correct architecture. I set the following environment variable to make compiling a bit easier.

```bash
export BUILD="aarch64-apple-darwin20.1.0"
```

## Download sources

It's possible to download and compile each package individually, but I find it much easier to stage all the downloads, verify signatures, extract files, etc. before compiling.

Here are the packages that I downloaded:

```bash
curl -L -o pkg-config-0.29.2.tar.gz http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/releases/pkg-config-0.29.2.tar.gz
curl -L -o pinentry-1.1.0.tar.bz2 https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/pinentry/pinentry-1.1.0.tar.bz2
curl -L -o libgpg-error-1.39.tar.bz2 https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libgpg-error/libgpg-error-1.39.tar.bz2
curl -L -o libgcrypt-1.8.7.tar.bz2 https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.8.7.tar.bz2
curl -L -o libksba-1.5.0.tar.bz2 https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libksba/libksba-1.5.0.tar.bz2
curl -L -o libassuan-2.5.4.tar.bz2 https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libassuan/libassuan-2.5.4.tar.bz2
curl -L -o ntbtls-0.2.0.tar.bz2 https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/ntbtls/ntbtls-0.2.0.tar.bz2
curl -L -o npth-1.6.tar.bz2 https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/npth/npth-1.6.tar.bz2
curl -L -o scute-1.6.0.tar.bz2 https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/scute/scute-1.6.0.tar.bz2
curl -L -o gnupg-2.2.25.tar.bz2 https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-2.2.25.tar.bz2
```

### Signatures

Verifying the signature or digest of downloaded source code is important to validate authenticity and reduce the possibility of supply chain vulnerabilities. I'm including the digests I used to validate the tarballs, but _you_ should always find and build the checksum file yourself from sources you trust. This is another great reason to use a package manager like Homebrew as this step is automatically performed when installing a package.

```bash

```

I saved those digests into a file called `SHASUMS` that I placed with all the tarballs.

```bash
shasum -c SHASUMS
```

## Compiling

These packages must be compiled and installed the order outlined below. I do recommend running `make check`, but it probably isn't critical for smaller libraries.

### `pkg-config`

`pkg-config` makes it much easier to include headers and link libraries as I compile each package.

```bash
tar xvf pkg-config-0.29.2.tar.gz
cd pkg-config-0.29.2
./configure --prefix=$PREFIX --build=$BUILD --with-internal-glib
make -j4
make check
make install
```

Once `pkg-config` is installed, add the following environment variable to your shell.

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/Users/corybuecker/tools/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
```

### `libgpg-error`

`libgpg-error` defines all the common errors for GnuPG programs.

```bash
tar xvf libgpg-error-1.39.tar.bz2
cd libgpg-error-1.39
./configure --prefix=$PREFIX --build=$BUILD
make -j4
make check
make install
```

### `libassuan`

`libassuan` provides an inter-process communication (IPC) protocol and library.

```bash
tar xvf libassuan-2.5.4.tar.bz2
cd libassuan-2.5.4
./configure --prefix=$PREFIX --build=$BUILD
make -j4
make check
make install
```

### `pinentry`

`pinentry` is used to securely read PINs and other passwords.

```bash
tar xvf pinentry-1.1.0.tar.bz2
cd pinentry-1.1.0
./configure --prefix=$PREFIX --build=$BUILD
make -j4
make install
```

### `libgcrypt`

`libgcrypt` provides all the cryptographic functions for GnuPG.

As of this post, the assembly versions of some functions will not compile on Apple Silicon. Hopefully, this will be updated in the near future.

`make check` will fail with a single failure on the `random` function. It appears to be [related to this issue](https://dev.gnupg.org/T2056), so I suspected a regression and I moved on with the installation.

```bash
tar xvf libgcrypt-1.8.7.tar.bz2
cd libgcrypt-1.8.7
./configure --prefix=$PREFIX --build=$BUILD --disable-asm
make -j4
make check
make install
```

### `libksba`

`libksba` is an easy-to-use interface for working with certificates.

```bash
tar xvf libksba-1.5.0.tar.bz2
cd libksba-1.5.0
./configure --prefix=$PREFIX --build=$BUILD
make -j4
make check
make install
```

### `npth`

`npth` is a portable threads library.

```bash
tar xvf npth-1.6.tar.bz2
cd npth-1.6
./configure --prefix=$PREFIX --build=$BUILD
make -j4
make check
make install
```

### `scute`

`scute` allows the GnuPG agent to work with smart cards. If you are not using a hardware key or smart card, skip this package.

```bash
tar xvf scute-1.6.0.tar.bz2
cd scute-1.6.0
./configure --prefix=$PREFIX --build=$BUILD --disable-dependency-tracking
```

Open the `Makefile` in an editor and look for this line, `SUBDIRS = m4 src ${tests} doc`. Remove `doc` from the end of that line. The documentation doesn't compile on Big Sur right now, but it's not critical.

```bash
make -j4
make install
```

The test suite will fail pretty broadly for `scute`. However, it appears to require a GnuPG agent to be running, which I don't have yet.


### `ntbtls`

`ntbtls` is a very small TLS 1.2-only implementation used only by GnuPG tools.

#### Note about GnuTLS

The GnuPG project promotes `ntbtls` from their download page but [provides a pretty big warning](https://gnupg.org/software/ntbtls/index.html). However, I don't have any real concerns using it in this specific case. If you do, the classic TLS library is [GnuTLS](https://www.gnutls.org). That's a much larger package with more dependencies, and I haven't tried compiling it yet.

```bash
tar xvf ntbtls-0.2.0.tar.bz2
cd ntbtls-0.2.0
./configure --prefix=$PREFIX --build=$BUILD
make -j4
make check
make install
```

### `gnupg`

Whew, we made it!

```bash
tar xvf gnupg-2.2.25.tar.bz2
cd gnupg-2.2.25
./configure --prefix=$PREFIX --build=$BUILD
```

Once GnuPG is configured, it will print out some details. Confirm that every feature besides `G13` is enabled. `G13` is a encrypted filesystem container tool which I will explore in the future.

```bash
make -j4
make check
make install
```

After installing, try running `gpg` in a new Terminal tab. It should prompt for a message to encrypt.

Wrapping up, there are a lot of dependencies to install. For the most part, they are straight-forward and `pkg-config` helps a lot with `CFLAGS` and library linking.
